This application is used to calculate opening and closing times of checkpoints in an ACP Brevet bicycle race. It does this through the algorithm in acp_times.py which divides the checkpoint distance by a set maximum/minimum speed and shifts the start time based on the calculation. In order to run the application build and run a docker container, the Dockerfile is all set up. The web service is used by inputting a total distance, start time, and the various checkpoint distances then it automatically calculates the open and close time of the checkpoints.
